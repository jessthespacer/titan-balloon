# titan-balloon
A program that optimizes the size and temperature of a Montgolfier balloon to carry a given payload at a given altitude. In this case, it is specifically aimed at usage on Saturn's moon, Titan.

Assumptions:
- Heat source is a NASA Kilopower nuclear reactor
- Atmospheric temperature, composition, and scale height are constant with altitude
- Balloon loses heat to convection and radiation; does not account for forced convection
